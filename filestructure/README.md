# Visual Template Nicely Compressed - Read and Write Lib.
C++ Library for a created file format (primarily) for my TV Head project

It works, but it might NOT be stable enough. ~~.vtnc is a thing now, I guess...~~

Things that are planned:

- [x] Working Layers
- [x] Alpha color
- [x] Frames
- [x] Read
- [x] Write
Its complete for now.

In the ./filestructure/ folder there are some files that are used in the FOSS [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex), as it really helps prototyping the file type itself.

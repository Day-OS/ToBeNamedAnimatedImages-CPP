# Visual Template Nicely Compressed - Read and Write Lib.
C++ Library for a created file format (primarily) for my TV Head project

This unfortunatelly is not working at the moment because it is at the process of an almost complete rewrite as it is not beautifully written.

Things that are planned:

- [x] Working Layers
- [x] Alpha color
- [x] Frames
- [ ] Read (Needs recoding)
- [ ] Write (Needs recoding)

In the ./filestructure/ folder there are some files that are used in the FOSS [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex), as it really helps prototyping the file type itself.
